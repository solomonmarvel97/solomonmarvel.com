    text: `It's a pleasure to collaborate with Marvelous. He is an excellent leader who is patient with everyone and eager to assist everyone. Without him, my transition into technology would not have been easy or smooth; even when I became stuck and frustrated, he guided me through the process. He has been helpful and understanding when I have asked for help.
    One of his kind and a natural leader. Marvelous is an excellent teacher.
    He will teach and coach you as long as you are willing to learn.
    I must say that in my four years with Marvelous, I have learned a great deal about programming, design, and business, as well as grown as a person.
    He has a broad mind that is well grounded and articulated.
    I could go on and on about his charitable work, but one thing is certain: meeting him was a miracle that I will never forget.`,
